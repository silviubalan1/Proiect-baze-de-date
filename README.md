## Description:  
In this project i am creating a local server by using xampp to host a database for a university project. I am accesing the database by using php and displaying the results on a site.

## Technologies Used  
* PHP: The back-end language handles data manipulation and communication with the database.

* SQL: The data definition language (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML) are used to create, manage, and query the database.  

* CSS: The styling language enhances the visual appearance of the website, ensuring a user-friendly interface.  

* HTML: Is used to provide the foundation for the website.  

## Installation
* Create a MySQL Database: Create a database named partial in your MySQL server.

* Import Database Structure: Run the cod sql tabele+procedura.txt in your sql workbench. This will create the necessary tables for storing the data.

* Configure Environment: Open xampp and run the module:apache and MySql.

## Usage
* Access the Website: Open your web browser and navigate to the local address http://localhost/.../main_page.html.

* Query the database: Based on underlying exercise , query the database differently for each exercise.
